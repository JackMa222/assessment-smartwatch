            <p id="dpst">Simple watches came long before the smart watch, originating from pocket watches between
                the
                15th and 16th century. The popularity and widespread availability of 'wrist watches' (what we call
                today
                as simply 'watches') began in the 19th century, and has developed since, evolving to highly advanced
                watches including mechanical, automatic, electrical and quartz watches, all at a varying price. Some
                of
                these watches also included the date (day/date/month). 'Digital watches': battery-powered watches that displayed the time and usually date on a LED or LCD screen gained popularity in the 1970s and has led to the evolution to smart watches.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Smart (or specifically ‘fitness’ type) watches also usually include
                            physical tracking metrics including steps, distance (km/miles), calories burnt, active
                            (intensity) minutes, heart rate trackers, and sleep data, including other statistics
                            based
                            on sleep like ‘body battery’ or ‘awake metres’. They also usually include goal alerts,
                            for
                            example reaching 10,000 steps, or a desired amount of ‘active’ minutes. On top of these
                            ‘background’ trackers, many watches allow the ability to record many different
                            activities
                            including: running, biking, walking, swimming, strength training, yoga, pilates, stair
                            steppers, indoor walking/running and many others. Outside activities often use the
                            onboard
                            GPS (global positioning system) to measure distance, speed and map out activities. Many
                            watches also include automatic activity detection that records what it thinks is
                            activities
                            based on past behaviors. Some fitness smart watches also allow for waist (strap) heart
                            rate
                            monitors to be connected to the watches.</p>

Smartwatches allow for parents to be able to track their children when they are out and about. Through the use of common smartwatch SOS features, people can alert authorities and close friends and family if they are in an unsafe situation. Fall Detection features are also important in smart watches, especially useful for older people, and alerts authorities and close friends and family in the same way of SOS features.</p>

                            model to model. These include music, podcasts, social media, e-reading, games and sports
                            updates. Some watches also include the ability for photo and video storage, as well as on-demand playback. This all varies based on the storage on each of these smart watches. Another key feature here is the ability to be connect to virtual (personal) assistants like Siri. These a key in improving productivity but also in accessing information quickly, through just using your voice.</p>

                            a 'credit-card' on your wrist to occur. This means that people can 'tap and go' from the
                            ease of their wrist. This is especially useful to people if they want to avoid carrying
                            cards and wallets around. For example, many cyclists use this feature when buying coffee
                            when on a ride.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Smart watches allow for many things, but one of the biggest is the way that it allows us to always be connected to the digital world around us. For example, we are now able to receive emails, text messages, notifications and more all from our wrist. Not only this, but replies can be effortlessly sent in a matter of seconds. The vast amount of information that can be accessed including weather, sports results, upcoming events and more all from our wrist provide us with information at any time we need it. The ability to set reminders and alarms on our wrist also keeps us ‘on-time’ and attempts to limit disruptions to our daily life is also essential in the modern world. All of the above features are available on smart phones, but smart watches 'unobtrusive' ability to do all this on someone's wrist is what makes it stand out and appropriate for digital connectivity.<br><br>However, smart watches do have some downfalls in this particular category. The main sacrifice between smart watches and mobile phones is the heavily differing screen sizes. This is especially noticeable as manufactures create larger and larger phone screens, many people 'cannot stand' to use the small screen size of smart watches. Some of the other downsides that might not make the the most appropriate for digital connectivity include: battery life, aesthetics, distractions and health concerns.</p>

                        Smart watches help people to better understand daily life and their health along with
                        physical activity. Not only this, but smart watches equip people to live healthy lives
                        through features that keep them 'physically active' and help them relax when they need to.
                        Smart watches also allow for monitoring of important health measures like heart rates,
                        allowing important intervention to sometimes fatal incidents. The convenience of smart watches to access information like weather, notifications, calendars, reminders, stopwatches and more allow ease during peoples busy lives. A key impact is also their time management features like alarms, reminders, calendar all of which that can be synced from a mobile phone allow for people to stay 'on time' through their watch.

                        Smart watches have connected members of society together but have also provided an
                        assumption to people that we must always be connected. This can be emotionally damaging as
                        it means taking a break from life can be significantly challenging when everything,
                        including messaging and emails are all linked to our wrist. Despite this, smart watches have led to an overall productivity and connectivity increase in both personal and work lives. They have also, on average, improved the health and wellbeing of many people through their fitness tracking and 'reminding' features. However, smart watches have also socially isolated some people thrrough the increased reliance on technology. As well as this, their are serious privacy (and security) concerns around smart watches, specifically on the data they might collect like location.

                        Smart watches have also had a large impact on the environment, as people are often quick to
                        dispose of their ‘old’ devices once a new model arrives. Not only this, but smart watches'
                        small form factor means animals are susceptible to consuming this, often leading to illness
                        or death. The extraction of minerals for these watches including rare earth metals and lithium also lead to environmental problems
                        including pollution of the environment that they are sourced from. While this can be done responsibily, the higher costs and current human demand make it a tough option for manufacturers to take.

                <p class="card-text">In the future, I predict that smart watches will be more technologically advanced
                    including more sensors but also equipped with AI technology that allows the watch to better
                    understand our life. I also see watches growing larger to allow for more technology but also larger
                    screens that means more information can be displayed at once. Eventually in the future I see smart
                    watches potentially replacing mobile phones or becoming the more 'important' of the two when they
                    become complex enough. I also see smart watches lowering in price and having a wide price range in the same way that phones have in the past few years. From this, I believe that a large amount of the population will have a smart watch, be it simple (maybe combined with a new phone?) or advanced like the current mainstream watches. I also see smart watches being an important tool in the workplace across many different industries as tool to speed up activities. For example, stud finders might be wirelessly connected to smart watches to provide results as well as advanced mapping of an area.</p>
